# Zoo Functions ü¶ç

<h3>Project Context</h3>

City Hall has given you an important mission: organize zoo information! üêò 

In this project, functions were developed to manage information about a fictional zoo. To ensure that the functions' implementation was correct, I performed some unit tests following the test-driven development method.

The information about the zoo is on `data/zoo_data.js`.
